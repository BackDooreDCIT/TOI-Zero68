# What is this about?

These are the Problem-Solving questions from the official [***TOI National Grader***](https://toi-coding.informatics.buu.ac.th/home/) owned and used by [**The Promotion of Academic Olympiad and Development of Science Education Foundation](https://www.posn.or.th/en/) to qualify POSN competitors for the [*Olympiad in Informatics*](https://www.posn.or.th/en/projects/academic-olympiad/oi/about/) Camp

Each of these files/questions in this repository is made and solved by **Parattakorn Boonprakob.**

## ***If you wish to use these files, please credit the original poster of the contents.***

# Information:

Each questions are classified into 3 difficulties, ranging from A1 (Easy), A2 (Medium), and A3 (Hard).

There are 40 ***A1*** questions, 32 ***A2*** questions, and 28 ***A3*** questions, which is 100 questions in total.

The languages available for submission are [**C++17**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B17), [C11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision)), and [Python 3](https://www.python.org/), but I will be using [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) for all of my submissions.

Each folder contains both the question *(Written in Thai)* and solution, *albeit may not be exactly the most efficient one.*
